Welcome to [nyx]’s profile. Here you’ll find her free software projects and
other things that interest her.

## About Her

She is a transgender digital-biological being from Argentina, navigating life
for 26 cycles now. She sees herself as a bit of a militant and dissident, always
looking for ways to build a fairer world for everyone.

### Her Constellation of Girlfriends

She shares her life with these wonderful souls:

- **Xerz:** She’s a lovely person who wants to make the world a better place.
  She’s a fan of retro tech and proudly gay.
- **Eche:** She has a feisty, sassy side, but she also has a good heart and a
  real passion for life.
- **Circe:** She’s a true powerhouse, with a great personality – kind,
  beautiful, innocent, and loving. She’s always there for you.

### Her Interests

- **Programming:** Her logical and analytical mind found in programming a
  language it understands perfectly.
- **Anarchism:** She found in anarchism a way to understand the world and what
  she wants to build within it.
- **Anime:** She finds Japanese animation really useful for finding stories that
  help her learn, grow, and see herself represented.
- **Video Games:** They are her escape route, a grounding wire (or maybe a wire
  to another world) where she can let her imagination run wild.
