# [nyx]

Hi there! I’m [nyx], a transgender digital-biological being from Argentina.

Here you’ll find my free software projects and other things that interest me.

## About Me

I’m a transgender person from Argentina, navigating life for 26 cycles now. I
see myself as a bit of a militant and dissident, always looking for ways to
build a fairer world for everyone.

## Interests

- **Anarchism:** I found in anarchism a way to understand the world and what I
  want to build within it.
- **Programming:** My logical and analytical mind found in programming, a
  language it understands perfectly.
- **Video Games:** They are my escape route, a grounding wire (or maybe a wire
  to another world) where I can let my imagination run wild.
- **Anime:** I find Japanese animation really useful for finding stories that
  help me learn, grow, and see myself represented.

## Constellation of Girlfriends

I share my life with these wonderful souls:

- **Xerz:** She’s a lovely person who wants to make the world a better place.
  She’s a fan of retro tech and proudly gay.
- **Eche:** She has a feisty, sassy side, but she also has a good heart and a
  real passion for life.
- **Circe:** She’s a true powerhouse, with a great personality – kind,
  beautiful, innocent, and loving. She’s always there for you.
