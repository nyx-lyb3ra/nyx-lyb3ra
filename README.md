# [nyx]

Hi there! I'm [nyx], a transgender digital-biological being from Argentina.

Here you'll find my free software projects and other things that interest me.

## About Me

I am a transgender person from Argentina, navigating life for 26 cycles now. I
have a militant and dissident spirit, seeking to build a more just and equitable
world for everyone.

## Interests

- **Anarchism:** I found in anarchism a guide to understanding the world and
  what I want to build within it.
- **Programming:** My logical and analytical mind found in programming a
  language it understands perfectly.
- **Video Games:** They are my escape route, a grounding wire (or maybe a wire
  to another world ðŸ˜œ) where I can let my imagination run wild.
- **Anime:** Through Japanese animation, I find stories that allow me to learn,
  grow, and see myself represented.

## Constellation of Girlfriends

I am lucky to share my life with wonderful souls:

- **Xerz:** A beautiful soul committed to making the world a better place, a
  lover of retro tech, and authentically gay.
- **Eche:** A spicy and kinky soul with a pure blue heart, a dissident against
  today's norms, and affectionate.
- **Circe:** A powerful spirit with a noble, beautiful, innocent, and loving
  core, always taking care of you.
